#4) Random Person Generator: [tricky]

(layout scroll on left
names in hat, weighted list
displayed, can't be chosen back to back.
shows in red, as selcted on the side)

- should mimic the real deal [layout, buttons, etc.]
- names on the left should be rendered. of a list of people (more likely be an object)
- people must be weghted (higher weight === more likely to be selected.)
- Must be randomly selected. The selected user should not be chosen again until at least everyone has been called on, except in the event of higher weights
- Must disply the selected user.

Extra: Even if you can't figure it out try to use this api to fetch the names: https://devpipeline-mock-api.herokuapp.com/api/get-users
to render the users. I want to see at least an attempt this. (comment out if you can't get it working) must be capitalized and concatinated.

- add some fun color phases, animations, etc.
